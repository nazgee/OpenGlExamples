After succesfull clone please go to project directory & run below command:

> android update project -p . -s

This will create build.xml file.

Now you can type:
ndk-build // This command will build all native c++ files and then link into shared library
ant debug // This will build apk package
adb install bin/NativeActivity-debug.apk // Now install apk file on your emulator/device
